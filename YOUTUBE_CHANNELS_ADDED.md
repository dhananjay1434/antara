## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Interest Detection**: AI analyzes user messages for keywords in each category
2. **Smart Fetching**: Only fetches content for categories where user shows genuine interest (confidence > 0.3, mentions ≥ 2)
3. **Natural Introduction**: Mentions content contextually in conversations:
   - "That reminds me of something I came across..."
   - "Speaking of that, I heard this interesting insight..."
   - "You know what's fascinating? I learned that..."

## 🎯 Indian Content Focus

Special attention to Indian creators for local relevance:
- **Cricket Aakash** - Cricket analysis in Indian context
- **Nikhil Kamath** - Indian business and investment perspective
- **Raj Shamani** - Indian entrepreneurship stories
- **Ranveer Allahbadia** - Indian lifestyle and business content
- **T-Series** - Indian music and entertainment

## 📊 Content Strategy

- **No spam**: Content only shared when contextually relevant
- **User-driven**: Adapts based on user engagement and feedback
- **Quality over quantity**: 1-2 videos per category, processed for key insights
- **Natural timing**: Integrated into conversations like a friend would share

## 🔄 Adaptive Learning

- **Positive engagement** → More content from that category
- **Negative feedback** → Less content, try different niches
- **Ignored content** → Gradually shift to other interests
- **Context awareness** → Only mention when conversation is relevant

The system now provides a rich, personalized content experience that grows with the user's interests and adapts to their preferences naturally.
