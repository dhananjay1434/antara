## **📊 Advanced Database Schema**

### **User Interests Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_interests (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'technology', 'sports', etc.
    interest_name TEXT NOT NULL,      -- Specific interest
    confidence_score REAL DEFAULT 0.1, -- How sure we are (0.0-1.0)
    mention_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,   -- How often mentioned
    engagement_level REAL DEFAULT 0.5, -- User engagement (0.0-1.0)
    first_detected TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_mentioned TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1
);
```

### **Trending Topics Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE trending_topics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    topic TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    trend_score REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    source TEXT NOT NULL,            -- 'google', 'news', 'serp'
    description TEXT,
    url TEXT,
    detected_at TEXT NOT NULL,

    response_sentiment TEXT,          -- 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral'
    engagement_score REAL DEFAULT 0.0
);
```

## **🔍 Interest Detection & Learning**

### **Smart Pattern Recognition**
```python
interest_categories = {
    'technology': ['ai', 'tech', 'software', 'programming', 'startup'],
    'entertainment': ['movie', 'music', 'netflix', 'celebrity', 'show'],
    'sports': ['cricket', 'football', 'tennis', 'match', 'tournament'],
    'education': ['study', 'college', 'course', 'exam', 'research'],
    'health': ['fitness', 'exercise', 'diet', 'wellness', 'medical'],
    # ... and 7 more categories
}
```

### **Context-Aware Extraction**
```python
def _extract_keyword_context(text, keyword):
    # Extract 2-3 words before and after keyword
    # "I love playing cricket with friends" → "love playing cricket with friends"
    # Creates meaningful interest phrases instead of just keywords
```

### **Progressive Learning**
```python
def _update_user_interest(user_id, category, interest, timestamp):
    if existing_interest:
        confidence_score += 0.1  # Increase confidence
        mention_count += 1       # Track frequency
        engagement_level += 0.05 # Boost engagement
    else:
        # Create new interest with initial confidence 0.2
```

## **🌐 World Awareness & Web Search**

### **Multi-Source Search System**
```python
search_engines = {
    'google': _google_search,    # Google search results
    'serp': _serp_search,       # SERP API (if available)
    'news': _news_search        # Google News search
}
```

### **Intelligent Query Generation**
```python
def _get_category_search_queries(category):
    queries = {
        'technology': ["latest tech news today", "AI breakthrough 2024"],
        'entertainment': ["trending movies 2024", "new music releases"],
        'sports': ["sports news today", "cricket match updates"],
        # Generates relevant search queries for each category
    }
```

### **Trend Caching System**
```python
trending_cache = {
    'trends_technology': {
        'trends': [...],
        'timestamp': '2024-01-20T10:30:00Z'
    }
}
# Cache valid for 2 hours to avoid excessive API calls
```

## **🎯 Personalized Content Delivery**

### **Interest-Based Recommendations**
```python
def _generate_interest_recommendations(user_profile):
    top_categories = user_profile['top_categories'][:3]
    
    for category, score in top_categories:
        if score > 0.3:  # Minimum interest threshold
            recommendations.extend(get_category_recommendations(category))
```

### **Smart Sharing Logic**
```python
def should_share_update(user_id, topic):
    category_score = user_interests[topic['category']]
    return category_score > 0.3  # Share if user has significant interest
```

### **Proactive Content Sharing**
```python
# 15% chance to share something interesting during conversation
if random.random() < 0.15:
    maybe_share_interesting_update(user_id)
```
